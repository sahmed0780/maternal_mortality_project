I have found maternal mortaly data according to region from 2007 to 2017 on CDC Wonder. It is an online database for the analysis of public health data. It is available in this website https://wonder.cdc.gov/. 
A second sets of dat that I am going to use in my paper is from IPUMS NHIS. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)is a survey collecting information on the health, health care access, and health behaviors of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population, with digital data files available from 1963 to present. IPUMS Health Surveys harmonizes these data and allows users to create custom NHIS data extracts for analysis. I have extracted health care access data and they are available in this website https://nhis.ipums.org/nhis/.

A third sets of Data is from IPUMS USA. I have extracted Health Insurance Dat from this website. IPUMS USA collects, preserves and harmonizes U.S. census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes decennial censuses from 1790 to 2010 and American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present.The web address for this data is https://usa.ipums.org/usa/.
